# Magic Color Picker

Magic Color Picker is a color picker with a unique twist - you can choose colors using natural language descriptions!

## ðŸŒˆ Magic Color Input

While standard options are included, the highlight is the Magic Color Input. Users can describe a color in words, and watch it turn into the selected color - almost instantly!

### How it works:

1. Type a color description in the magic input field.
2. Press Enter to generate the color.
3. The color picker updates to match your description.

### Example descriptions:

- "Sunset orange"
- "Deep sea blue"
- "Forest green after rain"
- "Warm summer day"

The Magic Color Input uses the text2color.com API to convert your descriptions into vibrant colors, adding a layer of creativity and intuition to the color selection process - perfect for customizable product pages.

## Other Features

While Magic Color Input steals the show, Magic Color Picker also includes standard color selection tools:

- Interactive color square
- Hue and opacity sliders
- Hex code input/output
- In this demo, a real-time background color updates

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
- git clone https://github.com/noahlittle/magiccolorpicker.git

- Start describing colors!

## Technical Note

The magic color feature requires an API key from text2color.com. For security, keep this key private in production environments.
